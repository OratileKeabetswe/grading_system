introduces dictionaries to store student data and adds features like searching and removing records.

section D
organizes the code using functions and introduces a menu system for easier program navigation.

section E
implements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Student and Gradebook classes to manage data.

section F
combines all previous sections with sorting, top student identification, and error handling.
